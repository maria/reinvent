# Use case

**Cambia** - first employer based health plan, transform healthcare on cloud for sustainability

### Features / tips 
  - Always HIPAA compliant
  - Build guardrails not gates
  - Uses cloudtrail for security, lambda event inspection
  - Then elastic for storage and reporting
  - Demo for lambda function checking logs and sending notifications
  - Cloud watch alerts for ec2, like region, not encrypted volumes etc
  - Using Ansible for config management

And another use case / thing with cats... Simple stuff around logging in AWS and
analyzing those logs / information, based on custom rules.
