# New stuff to try out

Really have to try:
  - LucidChart for AWS resources -> it imports automatically your AWS resources
    and you can arrange diagrams based on them. Pretty sweet.
  - Scality - S3 on localhost https://github.com/scality/S3
  - S3: Try the new console - it has a lot of new cool stuff.

Others:
  - Startoscale kubernetes, docker openstack
  - Aviatrix hybrid networks
  - Solodev - build it your way?
  - Rancher - container management platform
